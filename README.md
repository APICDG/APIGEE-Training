## Welcome to APIGEE Training

#### **What is API?**
APIs are services that user wants to expose so that app developers can consume them to use in their mobile or web applications.These APIs are exposed as a set of HTTP endpoints.Response will be either XML or JSON.

#### **Why APIGEE (API Management Tool)?**

API providers make their services available over the web, they must ensure that they have taken all necessary steps to secure and protect their services from unauthorized access. A service provider should consider the following points:

1. How will you control access to your services to prevent unauthorized access?
2. Will your services work across different platforms and devices?
3. How can you monitor your services to make sure they are available?
4. How can you track and bill customers for access to your services?

This is where APIGEE comes into picture by providing above features and letting the API provider concentrate on making his APIs available on web.

 **Apigee Edge** 

	Apigee Edge is a platform for developing and managing API proxies. 
For API-building, Apigee provides tools for adding and configuring user’s API proxies, setting up API products, and managing app developers and client apps. Apigee Edge is the flagship API management product in Apigee’s intelligent API platform. It provides a solution that addresses the entire digital value chain—from the backend systems of record through to the customer who interacts with an app or digital experience delivered by an API-powered mobile app or a connected device. 
Apigee Edge includes three components: Gateway Services, Developer Services, and Analytics Services.[...more](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/what-apigee-edge)

Edge Developer Services includes a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solution that provides developers with access to a flexible data store and enables you to quickly integrate valuable features into your app, including social graphs, user management, data storage, push notifications, performance monitoring, and more.

Using API BaaS, you can set up your own cloud-based data platform in minutes instead of months – no server-side coding or back-end development needed. This allows your team to focus on developing the rich features and user experience that truly differentiate your app, rather than on the time-consuming details of implementing core back-end services and infrastructure.[...more](http://docs.apigee.com/api-baas)

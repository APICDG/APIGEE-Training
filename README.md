## Welcome to APIGEE Training

#### **What is API?**
APIs are services that user wants to expose so that app developers can consume them to use in their mobile or web applications.These APIs are exposed as a set of HTTP endpoints.Response will be either XML or JSON.

#### **Why APIGEE (API Management Tool)?**

API providers make their services available over the web, they must ensure that they have taken all necessary steps to secure and protect their services from unauthorized access. A service provider should consider the following points:
**Security** - How will you control access to your services to prevent unauthorized access?
**Compatibility** - Will your services work across different platforms and devices?
**Measurability** - How can you monitor your services to make sure they are available?
**Monetization** - How can you track and bill customers for access to your services?
This is where APIGEE comes into picture by providing above features and letting the API provider concentrate on making his APIs available on web.
